Time crystal in a quantum computer

A ground-breaking discovery that opened up opportunities to explore new regimes in their field of condensed matter physics.
A time cryistal in itself has a similar structure to a normal crystal structure. The main difference is that time crystal repats not 
in space as the crystal structure but in time. This is a new phase of matter that runs with not further input of energy ~ an infinite clock 
with no need for electricity ~. 
This research done by a team of scientists form Stanford University and Oxford University was published November 30 in Nature.
