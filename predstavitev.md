# Time crystal in a quantum computer

# What is a time crystal
Similarly as the crystal structure repeats in space, the new phase of matter called "time crystal" repeats in time and does so indefinitly, without any further input of energy.
It can be thought of as a clock that runs forever without any need of electricity

# First ever time crystal

In research published Nov. 30 in Nature, a team of scientists from Stanford University and Oxford University detail their creation of a time crystal using Google's Sycamore quantum computing hardware.

# New opportunities

For the team, the excitement of their achievement lies not only in creating a new phase of matter but in opening up opportunities to explore new regimes in their field of condensed matter physics, which studies the novel phenomena and properties brought about by the collective interactions of many objects in a system.

Although the finite size and coherence time of the imperfect quantum device meant that their experiment was limited in size and duration so that the time crystal oscillations could only be observed for a few hundred cycles rather than indefinitely. A key signature of an ideal time crystal is that it shows indefinite oscillations from all states.

The researchers devised various protocols for assessing the stability of their creation. These included running the simulation forward and backward in time and scaling its size.

# Recipe

The basic ingredients to make this time crystal are as follows: The physics equivalent of a fruit fly and something to give it a kick. 
The fruit fly of physics is the Ising model, a longstanding tool for understanding various physical phenomena which consists of a lattice where each site is occupied by a particle that can be in two states, represented as a spin up or down.

What makes a time crystal unique is that it's a system of millions of things that are showing this kind of concerted behavior without any energy coming in or leaking out.

While this may sound suspiciously close to a "perpetual motion machine," a closer look reveals that time crystals don't break any laws of physics. Entropy remains stationary over time, marginally satisfying the second law of thermodynamics by not decreasing.

# Conclusion

Creating a new phase of matter is unquestionably exciting on a fundamental level. 
In addition, the fact that these researchers were able to do so points to the increasing usefulness of quantum computers for applications other than computing. 
You can even discover some new phenomenon that you hadn't predicted
